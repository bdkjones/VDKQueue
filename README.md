About
-----

VDKQueue is an Objective-C wrapper around kernel queues (kQueues).
It allows you to watch a file or folder for changes and be notified when they occur.

VDKQueue is a modern, streamlined and much faster version of UKKQueue, which was originally written in 2003 by Uli Kusterer.
Objective-C has come a long way in the past nine years and UKKQueue was long in the tooth. VDKQueue is better in several ways:

- The number of method calls is vastly reduced.
- Grand Central Dispatch is used in place of Uli's "threadProxy" notifications (much faster)
- Memory footprint is roughly halved, since VDKQueue creates less overhead
- Fewer locks are taken, especially in loops (faster)
- The code is *much* cleaner and simpler!
- There is only one .h and one .m file to include.

VDKQueue also fixes long-standing bugs in UKKQueue. For example: OS X limits the number of open file descriptors each process
may have to about 3,000. If UKKQueue fails to open a new file descriptor because it has hit this limit, it will crash. VDKQueue will not.

Performance
-----------

Adding 1,945 file paths to a UKKQueue instance took, on average, 80ms. 
Adding those same files to a VDKQueue instance took, on average, 65ms.

VDKQueue processes and pushes out notifications about file changes roughly 50-70% faster than UKKQueue.

All tests conducted on a 2008 MacBook Pro 2.5Ghz with 4GB of RAM running OS 10.7.3 using Xcode and Instruments (time profiler).

Requirements
------------

VDKQueue requires Mac OS X 10.6+ because it uses Grand Central Dispatch. VDKQueue uses ARC.
